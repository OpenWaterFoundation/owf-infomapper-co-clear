# Layer: RMNP Boundary #

The RMNP Boundary layer indicates the extent of Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP).
The Poudre River headwaters originate in [Poudre Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poudre_Lake),
which is in RMNP.  See:

*   [Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm)

RMNP provides water supply to Colorado entities from snowpack and surface water runoff.
These water supplies are generally very high quality but can be degraded by
active wildfires (ash, etc.), runoff from wildfire burn areas (sediment, minerals, solids),
and other pollutants (transported by air, spills, human and animal impacts, etc.).

The Colorado Big Thompson Project managed by Northern Water collects water from the west side of Colorado's continental divide
and delivers it to the east side.  The Adams Tunnel travels below RMNP as it delivers water from Lake Granby to Lake Estes
and down the Big Thompson River.  See:
