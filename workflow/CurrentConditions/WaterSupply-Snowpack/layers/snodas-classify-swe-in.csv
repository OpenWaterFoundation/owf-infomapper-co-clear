# Graduated classification table for SNODAS snowpack
# - the value corresponds to SWE depth in inches
# - use the same properties as the SNODAS tools but make transparent to work well with wildfires
# - see: https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-snodas-ng/blob/master/snodas-workspace/projects/snodas/src/app/main-content/map/map.component.ts
