## Overview

The Continental Divide map is useful to delineate the physical boundary between
Colorado's east and west slope river basins, counties, legislative districts, etc.
It also shows a barrier to wildfires, although some fires have crossed the divide.

This layer is useful to display behind other layers in maps.

**This map is not made available in the published website but can be displayed
during development by setting the Supporting Data menu visible.
The layer group and files are typically copied into other maps as needed.**

## Layer Groups

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| Continental Divide | Continental divide line, to help understand interbasin issues. |
| Background Layers | Background layers that provide a frame of reference. |
