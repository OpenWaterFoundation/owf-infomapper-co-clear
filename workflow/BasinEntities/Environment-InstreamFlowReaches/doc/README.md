## Introduction ##

The ***Basin Entities / Physical - Instream Flow Reaches*** map illustrates the locations of instream flow reaches in the basin,
as lines that generally follow the river/stream center line.

## Update Frequency ##

This product is updated multiple times a year,
based on CWCB instream flow water right appropriations.

## Datasets ##

The following are datasets for the map.

| **Dataset** | **Description** | **Data Source** |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Intream Flow Reaches | Stream linework with each instream flow right (reach) corresponding to a single line.  The CWCB maintains this dataset. | The data is originally from a statewide layer downloaded from the [State of Colorado CDSS website](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category).  It was then processed by OWF to split into water district layer and is available on the [CDSS Spatial Datasets for Colorado Water Districts and Divisions](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/co/cdss-data-spatial-bybasin/) website.  **The OWF dataset is older and uses the original GeoJSON specification.  The workflow reads the old GeoJSON and writes in latest specification.** |
| Intream Flow Termini | Upper and lower termini of instream flow reaches.  The CWCB maintains this dataset. | The data is originally from a statewide layer downloaded from the [State of Colorado CDSS website](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/gis-data-category).  It was then processed by OWF to split into water district layer and is available on the [CDSS Spatial Datasets for Colorado Water Districts and Divisions](http://data.openwaterfoundation.org/co/cdss-data-spatial-bybasin/) website.  **The OWF dataset is older and uses the original GeoJSON specification.  The workflow reads the old GeoJSON and writes in latest specification.** |

## Workflow ##

The following describes the workflow steps, which should be run in the order shown to fully regenerate the information products.

| **Command File/Script** | **Software** | **Description** |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `01a-download-instream-reaches.gp` | GeoProcessor | Download the instream flow reaches from OWF data website and rewrite to ensure latest GeoJSON format. |
| `01b-download-instream-termini.gp` | GeoProcessor | Download the instream flow termini from OWF data website and rewrite to ensure latest GeoJSON format. |
| `03-create-instream-reaches-map.gp` | GeoProcessor | Create the map configuration file and copy map and layer files to the distribution folder. |
