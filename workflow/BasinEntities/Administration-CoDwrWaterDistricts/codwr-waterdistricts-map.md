## Overview ##

The CO DWR Water Districts map shows basins used for water administration under the responsibility of
the [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](https://dwr.colorado.gov/).
Decisions about water in Colorado invariably involve water rights and their administration.
A water right is appropriated for a beneficial use of water,
such as agriculture, municipal, industrial, and environmental use.
A water right indicates the use type, amount allocated to the use, point of diversion,
and timing of the diversion.

## Comparison with Hydrologic Basins ##

Water Division and District boundaries do not exactly match hydrologic basins such as Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) basins.
The reason for this likely is due to the long history of water administration that predates the more
recent advent of geographic information systems and HUC basin nomenclature.

Water Divisions and Districts also stop at the Colorado state line.

These differences can pose challenges when analyzing and visualizing data.
Analysis that is related to water rights and related supply will typically be tied to water districts.
Analysis that is related to hydrology and environment may use datasets that link to hydrologic basins.

See the [***Basin Entities / Physical - Basins***](#map/entities-basins)
map for information about hydrologic basins.

## Layer Groups ##

The following layer groups are included in this map.

| **Layer Group** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| CO DWR Water Districts | Division of Water Resources water districts and divisions. |
| Continental Divide | Continental divide line, to help understand transbasin issues. |
| Background Layers | Background layers that provide a frame of reference. |
