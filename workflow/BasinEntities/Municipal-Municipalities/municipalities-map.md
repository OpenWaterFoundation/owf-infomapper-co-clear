## Overview ##

The Colorado Municipalities map provides information about Colorado municipalities,
focusing on water resources.

### Land Use ###

Land use and water use are related and depend on the characteristics of
a community, including factors such as:

*   lot size and landscaping, which impact outdoor water use amount and seasonal variation
*   number of residences, multi-family housing, and commercial properties
*   whether the community relies on tourism and recreation,
    in which case water use is higher due to visitors 

### Municipal Water Providers ###

Municipalities may be served by multiple water providers
(see also the [***Basin Entities / Water Supply - Water Providers***](#map/entities-water-providers) map),
which are typically utilities and special districts.
Depending on location, municipalities may rely on surface water and groundwater.

### Population ###

Each municipality's planning department (if they have one) typically
estimates historical and forecast population,
in order to make decisions about water resource raw and treated water supplies.
See the [***Basin Entities / Political - Counties***](#map/entities-counties) map for information about
population data.
